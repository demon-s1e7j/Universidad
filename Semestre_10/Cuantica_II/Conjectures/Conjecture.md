# Why you couldn't have $J_z$ in $J_x = J_y = 0$

## Whats the problem?

In the chapter 7.4.2 of the guide book there is an image of the geometrical interpretation of J. It is told that the values of $\hat{\vec{J}}$ could live in a sphere with radius $h\sqrt{j(j + 1)}$. However there is no values for $J_x = J_y = 0$

## Conjecture

I believe the important part in this problem is considering how if we live in a sphere of radius $h\sqrt{j(j + 1)}$ if we are in $J_x=J_y=0$ then the only possible value of $J_z$ is the radius (in magnitude we are talking, the direction will not be as relevant to this argument). However, $J_z = m\hbar$ and $m$ was defined in the last chapter as a quantum number as follow:

$$m = j_z \in \{-j, (-j + 1), (-j + 2), \ldots, 0, \ldots, (j - 2), (j - 1), j\}$$

That implies that $m$ could not take the values necessary for having points of $J$ on those situations.
